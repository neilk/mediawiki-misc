Some utilities for use with MediaWiki. Many of them are rather special-purpose for my 
needs; these are unlikely to have any use for anyone else.

* corify-msgs.pl, merge-msgs.pl - part of a complex process if you are moving messages from an extension to core

* getMessagesUsed.pl - scan a PHP source file for what messages are used.

* jsdistill, jsmin, jsminify - executables for minifying things, if you are debugging minifications

* makeRandomImages - uses the RandomImage libraries in the PHP unit tests to generate images with random
triangles. I use in a cron script, to have an endless supply of new images to upload.

* mft - utility for merging a number of changes from trunk
